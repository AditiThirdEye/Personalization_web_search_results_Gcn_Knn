# Personalization_web_search_results_Gcn_Knn
Unique thought experiment

In short : 

If you are a programmer the first thing when you type "ruby" in the search query the result should be ruby the programming language first then followed by the ruby the diamond.

But if you are a jewellery store worker then the first thing when you type "ruby" should be ruby the diamond and then ruby the programming language.
